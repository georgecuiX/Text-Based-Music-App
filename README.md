# Text Based Music App

## Description
This is a simple text-based music application developed as a part of a school project for a course named CPS209 (Computer Science II). This Java-based application simulates an online music platform, similar to popular services like Apple Music. It manages, stores, and plays various types of audio content, including songs, podcasts, and audiobooks. The application emphasizes the object-oriented approach, showcasing the use of classes, inheritance, and array lists in Java.

## Features
- **Audio Content Management:** Manages common information for all types of audio content.
- **Song and AudioBook Classes:** Specialized classes for different audio types with specific attributes like artist and composer for songs.
- **Audio Content Store:** Simulates an online store environment where users can "download" songs, podcasts, and audiobooks to their library.
